## üìö About the Project

**RuangIlmu** is a digital learning solution created to make learning easier and more enjoyable for elementary school students in grades 4-6. Recognizing the challenges students might face during self-study, we integrate smart technology to provide instant support and create a seamless and effective learning experience.

This project is a responsive and modern frontend implementation that interacts with a separate backend to provide rich functionality.

## ‚ú® Key Features

We are proud to present advanced features that set RuangIlmu apart from other platforms:

#### ü§ñ **Smart Learning Assistant (Chatbot)**
Students no longer need to feel confused when encountering difficult material. While reading a module, they can directly ask the integrated chatbot, which acts as a personal learning assistant, providing explanations and answers in real-time.

#### üìä **Automated Review Sentiment Analysis**
To continuously improve the platform's quality, we built a sentiment analysis system. Every review submitted by a user is automatically classified as **positive** or **negative**, allowing our team to quickly understand feedback and make improvements.

### Other Features:
- **User Authentication**: A secure registration and login system.
- **Interactive Dashboard**: A summary of learning progress and quick access to materials.
- **Learning Modules**: Materials structured according to the elementary school curriculum for grades 4-6.
- **Exercises & Quizzes**: Interactive questions to test understanding.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimal display on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
